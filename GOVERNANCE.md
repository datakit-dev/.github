# Governance

This document outlines the governance model for open source projects maintained by **DataKit, LLC**.

We believe in transparent, inclusive, and merit-based governance that empowers contributors while ensuring the long-term sustainability and quality of our projects.

## 1. Guiding Principles

- **Openness**: All discussions, decisions, and development happen in the open.
- **Meritocracy**: Contribution and merit earn trust and responsibility.
- **Consensus**: We aim to make decisions collaboratively and with community consensus.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

### Users
Anyone using our open source projects. Users are encouraged to:
- Submit bug reports and feature requests
- Ask questions or provide feedback
- Engage respectfully in community channels

### Contributors
Anyone submitting pull requests, documentation, tests, or other contributions.
- Contributions must follow the [contributing](https://github.com/datakit-dev/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines
- Contributions are reviewed by maintainers
- Active contributors may be invited to become Committers

### Committers
Contributors who have earned commit access through consistent, high-quality contributions.
- Review and merge pull requests
- Guide contributors and provide technical feedback
- Uphold project standards and code quality

### Maintainers
Members of the DataKit team and trusted long-term contributors who:
- Set the strategic direction of the project
- Make final decisions on disputes or complex changes
- Approve major releases
- Ensure the project's health and roadmap alignment

The initial Maintainers are members of DataKit, LLC.

## 3. Decision Making

We prefer **lazy consensus**: if no one objects, a proposed change is accepted after a reasonable time.

For larger decisions (e.g., architectural changes, deprecations), decisions follow this process:
1. **Proposal**: Open a GitHub Discussion or issue with an `RFC:` prefix.
2. **Community Feedback**: Open for comments for at least 5 business days.
3. **Maintainer Review**: Maintainers will summarize discussion and approve, reject, or request changes.

For breaking changes or disputes, a majority vote from maintainers will resolve the matter.

## 4. Communication Channels
- GitHub Issues and Discussions (primary)
- Joining the [DataKit Discord](https://discord.gg/ba7BVGhXGF)
- [oss@withdatakit.com](mailto:oss@withdatakit.com) for private communication

## 5. Code of Conduct

All participants must follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/datakit-dev/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We are committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone.

## 6. Contribution Guidelines

Please refer to the [contributing](https://github.com/datakit-dev/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines for:
- Development setup
- Coding conventions
- How to submit issues and pull requests

## 7. Maintainer Changes

Maintainers may be added or removed by consensus of the existing Maintainers. Inactivity for an extended period (6+ months) may result in removal to ensure project responsiveness.

## 8. Amendments

This GOVERNANCE.md may be modified via pull request and approved by Maintainers through the standard decision-making process.
